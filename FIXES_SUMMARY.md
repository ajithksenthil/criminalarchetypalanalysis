# Summary of Data Cleaning Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Overly Aggressive Data Removal
**Problem**: The initial data cleaning was removing ALL rows where Value = "Unknown", which eliminated important data points.

**Fix**: Commented out the line that removed Unknown values in `data_cleaning.py`:
```python
# Don't remove Unknown values - they are valid responses
# df_clean = df_clean[df_clean['Value'] != 'Unknown'].copy()
```

### 2. Python None vs String "None" Confusion
**Problem**: When criminals had no data for certain attributes, the system returned Python `None`, which was then converted to the string "None" in filenames, creating separate categories from "Unknown".

**Fix**: Updated `analysis_integration.py` to convert `None` to "Unknown":
```python
# Convert None to "Unknown" for consistency with data cleaning
if val is None:
    val = "Unknown"
```

## Results

### Before Fixes
- Files like `state_transition_Abused_drugs_None.png` and `state_transition_Abused_drugs_Unknown.png`
- Inconsistent handling of missing data
- Lost all "Unknown" values from analysis

### After Fixes
- Only `state_transition_Abused_drugs_Unknown.png` (no more "None")
- Consistent handling of missing data
- "Unknown" values properly retained for analysis
- Better statistical power by consolidating equivalent categories

## Verification
The fixes successfully consolidated:
- "None" (Python None) → "Unknown"
- "MISSING" → "Unknown"
- "nan" → "Unknown"
- "?" → "Unknown"
- "" (empty) → "Unknown"

While keeping distinct:
- "Yes" (including "yes", "YES", "1", "true")
- "No" (including "no", "NO", "0", "false")
- "Unknown" (all missing data representations)

This provides cleaner, more statistically robust analysis while maintaining the important distinction between "No" (explicitly negative) and "Unknown" (no data available).
