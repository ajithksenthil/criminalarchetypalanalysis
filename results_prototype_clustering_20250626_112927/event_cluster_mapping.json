    "Jack Tulip died. Black claims to have no memory of him, indeed, no memories at all before the age of five. Although locals remember how Robert Black was frequently heavily bruised as a boy, Black himself cannot recall how he got these injuries.  He recalls no abusive behavior from Jack, though he does remember how Margaret used to lock him in the house as a punishment for bad behavior, or alternatively, pull down his trousers and underwear and spank him with a belt. At nights Robbie was scared that there was a monster under his bed waiting to get him, and used to suffer from a recurring nightmare featuring a 'big hairy monster' in a cellar full of water. When he awoke he frequently found that he had wet the bed, which invariably provoked a beating. To his classmates at primary school Robert - or 'Smelly Robbie Tulip' as he was known - is remembered as having been an aggressive and slightly wayward boy. Having said this, in the period that he was living with the Tulips, Robert never really got himself into any serious trouble: he had childish fights, played up at school, and bullied the younger children, yet he seemed to avoid anything more serious than a rebuke from Williams for swearing in front of ladies. His first sexual experience, which is one of his first memories, was when he was only five. Black vividly recalls himself and a little girl undressing and looking at each other's sexual parts": 2,

We took her knickers off, lifted her skirt and all tried to put our penises in.' Finding that they couldn't complete the act of penetration, the boys contented themselves instead with touching the girl's vagina. When asked if she was consenting to this, Black told Wyre: 'I was forcing her, like, you know?' The incident was exposed and the authorities decided that Black would be better suited to a home with stricter discipline, not to mention an all-male environment.": 4,
    "Red House in Musselburgh. For at least a year, possibly two, out of the three that Black was at the Red House, a male member of staff - now dead - regularly sexually abused him.

Slightly above average academically, but it was sport that he was really interested in, especially football, swimming and athletics.": 4,

Choked her until unconscious and raped her. Left after he was done. She was found later wandering the streets: bleeding, crying and confused. Case was brought to court and astoundingly Black was given an admonishment, a verdict particular to Scottish law, which is effectively no more than a warning to be on good behavior in the future. Lost job. Moved to Kinlochleven": 8,
    "Found guilty of three counts of indecent assault and sentenced to a year of Borstal training to be served at Polmont, near Grangemouth.": 4,
    "\"Moved to London. Poor eyesight put a career in professional football beyond his reach. Obsession with young girls was growing": 6,

    "Dodd wrote in his diary that 'if I can get it home, I\u2019ll have more time for various types of rape, rather than just one quickie before murder.' Like most sociopaths, he depersonalized his target victims.": 9,

Dodd told them to get off their bikes, 'I want you to come with me.' They did what he said and went with Dodd. Dodd stabbed Billy in the stomach and then attacked Cole as he jumped up catching him in the side with his knife. Billy tried to run away but Dodd caught and stabbed him in the shoulder.": 2,

He would be a loner, and probably kept photos of his victims, a diary of his offenses, including clipped articles, and child pornography. The killer probably chose boys because he saw girls as 'defective.' Although this profile accurately described Dodd, it wasn\u2019t enough to conjure up a definitive suspect.": 4,
    "Composite sketches were released, and hundreds of calls came in from people who thought they had seen Lee with someone, but there were no solid leads.

    "Dodd read a statement to the judge that indicted him on all charges and admitted all his crimes were premeditated. His defense did not call any witnesses nor did they present any evidence. His attorney did try to argue that he was insane because no sane person would write an account such as Dodd did.": 4,
    "Jury gives Dodd the death penalty. After being sentenced, Dodd asked to be hung because he believed it was the most appropriate execution since he stated: 'that\u2019s the way Lee Iseli died.' The judge agreed and set the execution date for January 5, 1993.": 5,

Their goal was to get some gold and valuables. They hopped on top of a portable toilet and got up on the roof. They then entered through the using the hatch to the roof. They filled the two duffle bags with jewelry and valuables wroth about $15,000. When they got in the car and drove for a minute, a cop pulled them over. The cop asked them what they were doing behind the building and they said they had to go to the bathroom. The cop wrote down their names and addresses and let them go.": 4,
    "He acted like he was going to do a drug deal with two guys. When the guys went in his trunk to get a large quantity of marijuana, Gary took off on foot. Gary had taken $12,000 from the guys. Gary later came back to the same parking lot where they had met and stole the car the two guys had came in. The two guys then went to the police and said Gary Evans robbed them of $12,000 at gun point and then stole their car. He traveled from Troy to Cohoes, New York. As Evans pulled into town, he ran a red light. A cop saw him and turned on his lights to pull him over. Evans thought he was being pulled over for the burglary and took off, throwing the gun and his fake identification out of the vehicle. Evans finally gave up. Police later retrieved the gun and the fake identification.": 2,
    "Gary moved from the Cohoes County Jail to the Albany County Jail where Jim Horton (an investigator) could talk to him. Evans confessed to Horton that he and Falco had been tipped off about how to get into the building by the father of someone they knew. He then had to sign a statement. He was waiting for sentencing of charges of criminal possession of a weapon, first degree armed robbery, and grand larceny and burglary of a jewelry store.

    "Killed  Michael Falco age 30. Evans uses a .22-caliber pistol with a homemade silencer made of door screen and duct tape to shoot Michael Falco in the back of the head. It happened in Gary, Michael, and Tim\u2019s apartment in New York. Tim Rysedorph was upstairs in their apartment at the time. Evans put the body in the trunk of Tim\u2019s car. Evans then got Tim to help him wrap the body in a sleeping bag. They then drove all the way to Lake Worth, Florida (in Palm Beach County) where Gary\u2019s sister Robbie lived. They buried Falco near his Robbie\u2019s house and stayed in Florida for about 6 weeks. They then went back to New York. The reason Evans shot Falco was because Tim Rysedorph told him that Michael Falco had stolen a piece of stolen jewelry from him. In reality, Rysedorph has stolen the necklace and given it to a lady the three men knew well. After Evans had killed Falco, he found out Tim had lied when he saw a lady he knew wearing the necklace. The lady said Timmy had given it to her.": 2,

She wrote that someone had called her and disguised themselves as Gary. She said it sounded just like him. The person said something about having a fetish with animals and then bragged about having sex with animals. It angered Gary, but he dropped the subject quickly.": 2,
    "Gary wrote to Robbie that he had a visit from one of the Harrington twins. The twins were Steve and Bob. Steve is the twin that came to visit him. Steve and Gary were 'business acquaintances' according to Gary. In addition, they had known each other for a long time, but it was not a friendship. Around this same time in jail, he started fantasizing about his ex-girl friend and her family he had not seen in close to 15 years. He planned on finding her and killing anyone who got in his way, including her current husband.": 2,
    "Gary was moved to Clinton Correctional Facility. He was placed under protective custody by his counselor because he believed some of the Hells Angels were still after him. He wrote to Horton complaining that the police were holding him a little over 2 years (when his sentence had a maximum of 4 years). His release date was suppose to be in December of 1987, but he was informed it would not be until March of 1988. Evans wrote a letter to Horton and asked him to contact Torri Ellis (Falco\u2019s common-law wife) to see if she has heard anything about Michael Falco.": 2,

While workingnat these places, he was still committing burglaries on the side. During this time, he was committing more crimes than he ever had before.": 4,
    "Evans and Cuomo were pulled over and were asked to step out of the vehicle. The trunk was searched and the cops found all of the items they needed to commit a burglary and/or a kidnapping including 3 ski masks, 2 stun guns, a police scanner, 2 walkie talkies, a slim jim, crowbar, screwdrivers, duct tape, rope, 2 sets of handcuffs, gloves, hats, several maps of the Northeast, and a book on police radio frequencies. The cops did not do a thorough enough job because there was stolen merchandise in the door panels and under a carpet in the trunk. The two men were booked at the Albany Thruway State Police barracks. Evans and Cuomo would often wear shoes that were 3 or 4 sizes too big when committing the crimes in order to throw off police.": 3,

The hole had a wooden makeshift door on it. He covered Damien with top soil. He then covered the door with top soil and some brush. He decided to kill Cuomo because he supposedly ripped Evans off on the Watertown job. Evans only got about $15,000 for the Watertown job. Evans believed he should have received more money out of the stolen merchandise. Soon after killing Damien Cuomo, Gary went to Florida with his girlfriend at that time (she lived just down the street from Lisa and Damien). He brought her so it would not be so apparent he was hiding something.": 2,
    "Evans goes to California to see Stacy, a former ex-girl friend he was obsessed with. He had not seen her for about 15 years. He planned to take her away from her husband and make her love him. He said that if he had to he would kill her husband. When Evans gets to California, he shows up at her work and later has an argument with her husband.

Rysedorph had been helping Evans clean out their storage room at Spare Room II Storage Facility of their stolen items. He then cut his body up with a chainsaw and bagged his body up in 5 pieces. Each part was bagged and tapped and then placed into a cardboard box. He rationalized his acts because he had to transport the body to the burial site on a steep hill in Brunswick, New York. Rysedorph was buried in a shallow grave. He tosses the gun on his way out of the storage facility. He tossed it over a fence and in a ditch that runs along the interstate. Evans said he tossed the chain saw into the Hudson River, but it was never found. After the murder, Evans jumps probation. Nobody was able to track him down for about 7 months.
