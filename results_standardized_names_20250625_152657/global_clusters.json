Evans had led Lisa to believe Cuomo was still alive and had just left her and his daughter behind. Evans also admitted to killing Michael Falco on this day and told Horton he was buried near his sister’s house in Lake Worth, Florida. He was not transported to Florida to show them where he placed the body because he was considered to be too high of an escape risk."

The killer's actions illustrate a chilling disconnect from empathy, as he not only commits multiple murders but also manipulates the emotions of those close to the victims, such as Lisa Morris. This theme of control is further emphasized by his confessions and the manner in which he leads investigators to the victims' bodies, showcasing a desire for recognition and dominance even after the acts of violence."

This pattern suggests a trajectory towards criminal behavior stemming from deep-seated issues of rejection and inadequacy."
