üéØ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
   The lexical bias reduction is applied to embeddings but not to the text
   used for representative sample selection and cluster analysis.

üîß SOLUTION NEEDED:
   1. Process text BEFORE embedding generation
   2. Store processed text alongside original text
   3. Use processed text for:
      - Embedding generation
      - Representative sample selection
      - Cluster labeling
      - All text analysis

üí° IMPLEMENTATION:
   1. Modify data loading to apply lexical bias reduction early
   2. Keep both original and processed versions
   3. Use processed version for analysis, original for reference

üöÄ COMMAND TO RUN CORRECTED ANALYSIS:
   python run_modular_analysis.py \\
     --type1_dir=type1csvs \\
     --type2_csv=type2csvs \\
     --output_dir=output_corrected_bias_reduction \\
     --auto_k --match_only --no_llm \\
     --embedding_model=all-mpnet-base-v2 \\
     --use_lexical_bias_reduction \\
     --n_clusters=5

üìä EXPECTED RESULTS:
   - Representative samples should contain [PERSON], [LOCATION], etc.
   - No specific names or places in cluster descriptions
   - Focus on behavioral patterns rather than individual cases
   - Improved clustering quality due to reduced lexical bias
