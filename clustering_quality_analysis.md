# Clustering Quality Analysis

## Summary of Clustering Metrics

### 1. Event Clustering Metrics (Life Events)

### 2. Criminal Clustering Metrics (Based on Transition Patterns)
- Silhouette Score: ~0.158 (better than event clustering)
- 3 clusters of criminals based on their life trajectory patterns

## Why is Clustering Quality Poor?

### 1. **Nature of Life Event Data**
- Life events are inherently overlapping and not clearly separable
- Events like "physical abuse" can co-occur with various other life events
- Natural language descriptions create fuzzy boundaries between event types

### 2. **Low Silhouette Scores (0.022 - 0.064)**
- **Interpretation**: Scores close to 0 indicate clusters are overlapping
- **Expected for this data**: Life events don't form discrete, well-separated groups
- **Comparison**: The clustering comparison showed improved methods achieved 0.627 silhouette score with k=15 and SVD preprocessing

### 3. **High Davies-Bouldin Scores (3.0 - 4.8)**
- **Interpretation**: Higher scores indicate poorer cluster separation
- **Trend**: Scores worsen as K decreases (K=12 → 3.0, K=5 → 4.8)
- **Implication**: Events within clusters are dispersed, clusters are close to each other

### 4. **Data Characteristics**
- **Sample size**: Only 76 criminals with complete data
- **Event imbalance**: Dominant cluster (Cluster 2) contains 74.6% of events in stationary distribution
- **Missing data**: Many Type 2 attributes have "Unknown" values
- **Rare events**: Some conditions (e.g., physical abuse) affect very few criminals (3 out of 69)

### 5. **Methodological Factors**
- **TF-IDF embeddings**: May not capture semantic similarity well for short event descriptions
- **K-means limitations**: Assumes spherical clusters, which may not fit the data structure
- **Fixed K selection**: Analysis shows optimal K varies by metric (K=2 vs K=15)

## Key Insights

1. **Event clustering is inherently challenging** due to the continuous, overlapping nature of life experiences
2. **Criminal clustering performs better** (0.158 silhouette) because it groups individuals based on overall trajectory patterns
3. **The dominant cluster phenomenon** (74.6% in Cluster 2) suggests most events follow common patterns
4. **Validation metrics are stable** (ARI = 0.77 ± 0.13), indicating the clustering is reproducible despite low separation

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Alternative clustering methods**:
   - Hierarchical clustering for better handling of overlapping groups
   - DBSCAN for density-based clustering without assuming K
   - Gaussian Mixture Models for soft clustering

2. **Better embeddings**:
   - Use sentence transformers (when online) for semantic similarity
   - Domain-specific embeddings trained on criminology texts
   - Multi-modal embeddings combining text and structured features

3. **Data improvements**:
   - Standardize event descriptions
   - Reduce missing values in Type 2 data
   - Increase sample size beyond 76 criminals

4. **Different validation approaches**:
   - Focus on predictive validity rather than internal cluster metrics
   - Use domain expert evaluation of cluster coherence
   - Evaluate based on downstream task performance
